    #### Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç

    Our mission is to help you identify plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Your Plant Image:** Navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of your plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Advanced Analysis:** Our system processes the image using cutting-edge algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **View Results:** Get detailed insights and recommendations for further action based on the analysis.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques ensures precise disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Designed for simplicity, our interface offers an intuitive experience for all users.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results swiftly, empowering quick decision-making for better crop management.

    ### Getting Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us

        #### About Dataset
        This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the [original dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset). 

        It consists of approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. 
        The dataset is split into an 80/20 ratio for training and validation sets, preserving the directory structure. 
        An additional directory containing 33 test images was created later for prediction purposes.

        #### Dataset Structure
        - **Train:** 70,295 images used for training.
        - **Test:** 33 images reserved for testing.
        - **Validation:** 17,572 images for model validation.

        #### Purpose
        This dataset trains our ML models to accurately identify plant diseases, supporting farmers and agriculture enthusiasts in crop management.

        For more details, please refer to the [original Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).
